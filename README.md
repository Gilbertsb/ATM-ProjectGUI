NB: Find runnable jar and its shortcut in ".....out\artifacts\ATM_ProjectGUI_jar"

#EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
-------------------
You will have to add external libraries in your project those libraries will help your java program to connect and work with Database they are named like this(commons-lang-2.6, commons-logging-1.1.1, hsqldb, jackcess-2.0.4, ucanaccess-2.0.8 ) all these libraries help your project to interact with External Database(MS-Acess)and you will find them in folder named libraries in this project

#IMPORTANT
----------
When you open you project for the first time it create default folder to store Database in local disk  C:, the folder is named db_atm (C:/db_atm) this folder contain database for this project to access the database is named atm, so I want you to keep that in mind.

#HOW THE PROGRAM WORK 
---------------------

This is Java ATM PROJECT Simulation, and to access it you will will have to run file called (ATM-Simulation in out\artifacts\ATM_ProjectGUI_jar) then you will be asked to provide card number then pin, we have provided all of them here; two numbers are card number and four number are pin{(card_number,pin)(11,7777),(12,3333),(13,6666),(14,5555),(16,1111)}, and after getting in the program you will have choose any option by clicking on it.

Then for every option you will have to provide card and pin to proceed, please do it well i You don't it will not work

Within this ATM simulation you can;
-----------------
  -WITHDRAW (You will provide card and pin then amount)
  
  -CHACK BALANCE (You will provide card and pin)
  
  -CHANGE PIN    ( You will provide card and pin and new pin)
  
  -EXIT (You just have to click)
  
Please provide the  card and pin number in respective order to make sure you can use the database

Whatever change you make changes stay permanentry, like you will always consider those changes you made while using this ATM Simulation

Enjoy using ATM-Simulation!!!!!!!!
